Description: # pspso
        
        pspso is a python library for selecting machine learning algorithms parameters.
        The first version supports two single algorithms: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
        It supports two ensembles: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pspso.
        
        ```bash
        pip install pspso
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### MLP Example
        pspso is used to select the machine learning algorithms parameters. It is assumed that the user
        has already processed and prepared the training and validation datasets. Below is an example for using the 
        pso to select the parameters of the MLP. It should be noticed that pspso handles the MLP random weights intialization issue
        that may cause losing the best solution in consecutive iterations.
        ```python
        from pspso import pspso
        params = {"optimizer":['adam','nadam','sgd','adadelta'],
            "learning_rate":  [0.01,0.2,2],
            "hiddenactivation": ['sigmoid','tanh','relu'],
            "activation": ['sigmoid','tanh','relu']}
        task='binary classification'
        score='auc'
        number_of_particles=4
        number_of_iterations=5
        p=pspso('mlp',params,task,score)
        p.fitpspso(X_train,Y_train,X_val,Y_val,number_of_particles=number_of_particles,
                       number_of_iterations=number_of_iterations)
        p.printresults()
        ```
        
        In this example, four parameters were examined: optimizer, learning_rate, hiddenactivation, and activation.
        The number of neurons in the hidden layer was kept as default.
        
        ### Details
        
        The user is given the chance to handle some of the default parameters such as the number of epochs. 
        The user can modify this by changing a pspso class intance. For e.g., if you need to change the number of epochs from 50 
        to 10 for an MLP training:
        ```python
        from pspso import pspso
        task='binary classification'
        score='auc'
        p=pspso.pspso('mlp',params,task,score)
        p.defaultparams['epochs']=10
        
        ```
